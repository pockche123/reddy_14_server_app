# Lap1_final_project

## description

It is a fun and engaging web application designed to make the entire learning experience more exciting for non-STEM subjects(for now it only has a geography game).

This is achieved by transforming the learning experience into a quiz-like game, where students can choose their own usernames, play at different difficulty levels, and earn scores based on their performance.
There is also a leaderboard that displays the usernames and scores of the players who achieved the highest scores to encourage competitiveness in the game.
